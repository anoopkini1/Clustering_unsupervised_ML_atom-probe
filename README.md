# Unsupervised_Machine-Learning__Clustering__Atom-probe


This repository unveils an unsupervised machine learning based clustering algorithm for atom probe tomography experimental data. The dataset contains over 18 million data entries and was gathered during my doctoral research work. An associated [publication]( https://github.com/anoopkini1/Unsupervised_Machine-Learning__Clustering__Atom-probe/blob/main/Kini%20et%20al.%202020_clusters%20in%203D%20printed%20Cu-Cr%20alloy.pdf) reveals further details about the work. The work has been further extended and presented in this repository.

The repository contains .ipynb jupyter script files for:
- (1) reading the experimental atom probe file and data preparation
- (2) Development of a HDBSCAN clustering algorithm which distinguishes itself from previously published work, on the basis of model hyper parameters.
