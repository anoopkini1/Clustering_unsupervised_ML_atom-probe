# Unsupervised_Machine-Learning__Clustering__Atom-probe


This repository unveils an unsupervised machine learning based clustering algorithm for atom probe tomography experimental data for a 3D printed material sample. The dataset contains over 18 million data entries that correspond to one among several experimental trials performed during my doctoral research. This work has been [published]( https://github.com/anoopkini1/Unsupervised_Machine-Learning__Clustering__Atom-probe/blob/main/Kini%20et%20al.%202020_clusters%20in%203D%20printed%20Cu-Cr%20alloy.pdf), in which relevant details can be found. The work has also been subsequently developed.

The repository contains .ipynb jupyter script files for:
- (1) Data preparation and reading of an experimental atom probe file that serves as input to the machine learning model.
- (2) Development of an HDBSCAN clustering algorithm that distinguishes itself from previously published work, based on model hyperparameters.
